Mobile App Scripting – Final Portfolio of Evidence (MAST5112)

 Overview
This React Native app was developed as part of the final Portfolio of Evidence.  
It allows a chef to manage a restaurant’s menu and a guest to view and filter dishes.

The app demonstrates:
- Use of `for` and `while` loops in TypeScript
- Use of functions to organise and refactor code
- Use of global variables and context
- Use of arrays to store and update menu items dynamically
- Clean UI and working navigation between screens
